# Testing and Learning



> 1. **Start Epsilon: The initial exploration rate at the beginning of training, determining the likelihood of the agent taking random actions.**
> 2. **Learning Rate: A parameter that controls how much the agent updates its knowledge based on new information or rewards.**
> 3. **Final Epsilon: The minimum exploration rate the agent should reach over time, shifting its focus from exploration to exploitation of learned knowledge.**
> 4. **Exploration Level: The extent to which an agent explores the environment by taking random actions instead of relying on its current knowledge.**
